I wanted to follow along Brackey's latest video and experiment with 3D game development in Godot

## 3D Physics Engine
Brackey's suggested to use the Jolt Engine, I went ahead and installed it via the Asset Library. Apparently Jolt will ship with Godot 4.4 out of the box, so I can update this project later when Godot 4.4 releases it's first stable version.
